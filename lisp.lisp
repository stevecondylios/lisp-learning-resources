;;; DEFINING VARIBLES

;;; sc note this:

;;; CL-USER> (defvar aaa 5)
;;; CL-USER> (defvar aaa 7)
;;; CL-USER> (print aaa)
;;; 5
;;;
;;; CL-USER> (setf aaa 9)
;;; CL-USER> (print aaa)
;;; 9

;;; in other words, defvar is like orequals, except ||= will define if the object is
;;; nil, whereas I don't think defvar does that. Basically defvar will set the
;;; variable only if it isn't already defined e.g. useful for global variables
;;; so tl;dr someone like me who rarely uses globals probably should just stick
;;; to using defparameter rather than defvar


(defparameter aaa 5)
(print aaa)
;;; 5

(defparameter aaa 7)
(print aaa)
;;; 7
;;; sc: yup, for behaviour more like what I'm used to, use defparamater rather than defvar





(defvar x 6)

(print 5)

(print x)


;;; quick summary of 5 ways to define variables in common lisp


;;; Defines a global variable and initializes it with a value. The variable can be changed later.
(defparameter *var* 10)


;;; Similar to defparameter, but if the variable already exists, it does not reinitialize it.
(defvar *var* 10)


;;;setq sets the value of a variable. Can be used for both local and global variables.
(setq var 20)

;;; let defines local variables scoped within a block.

(let ((x 10)
      (y 20))
  (+ x y))


;;; let* similar to let, but allows for variables defined in the form to depend on those defined earlier
(let* ((x 10)
       (y (+ x 10)))
  (+ x y))




;;; some great examples from a stack overflow answer:
;;; https://stackoverflow.com/a/1475814/5783745
;;;
(set ls '(1 2 3 4)) => Error - ls has no value

(set 'ls '(1 2 3 4)) => OK

(setq ls '(1 2 3 4)) => OK - make ls to (quote ls) and then have the usual set

(setf ls '(1 2 3 4)) => OK - same as setq so far BUT

(setf (car ls) 10) => Makes ls '(10 2 3 4) - not duplicated by setq/set

(reduce #'-
        (reverse (list 1 2 3)))
;; â‡’ 0
;; sc: explanation: first the list is reversed (so it's 3 2 1), then reduce applies the - (subtraction)
;; operator to each of the successive elements e.g. 3-2, then the result - 1, =0
;; in other words 'reduce' successively applies the function to the first and second elemnts and moves along
;; to go through all elements
;; + might have been a simpler (if less elegant) example:

(reduce #'+
        (list 1 2 3 4))

;;; Anatomy of a macro:
;;;
;;; Backquote: This is a special quoting mechanism used in Lisp macros.
;;; It allows parts of the quoted list to be evaluated and interpolated into the list,
;;; which is crucial for constructing new code dynamically.
;;;
;;; Comma: The comma is used within a backquoted expression to indicate that
;;; what follows is an expression that should be evaluated and the result spliced
;;; into the code during macro expansion.
;;;
;;; Splice (,@): The ,@ operator is used before an expression that results in a list,
;;; and it means that the list should be "spliced" into the surrounding code.
;;; That is, instead of inserting the list itself,
;;; the elements of the list are inserted.
