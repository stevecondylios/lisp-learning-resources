;; BEST WAY TO LOOK UP DOCS
;;
;; M-x sly-describe-symbol ; MUST have cursor on the thing you want documentation for
;; NOTE you can just use SPC m h h, or even better, just K in doom emacs!
;; incredible. So tl;dr to look up documentation, just move the point
;; over the first character of the function call, and press K in emacs (evil mode)
;; Reference is made to precisely this method of looking up documentation in
;; default ~/.config/doom/config.el file! - here's the important bit:

;; | To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; | the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; | This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.

;; EXAMPLE
;; on line 35 of ~/.config/doom/config.el we see:
;; (setq doom-theme 'doom-one)
;; to get documentation for the (setq) function, move the point (cursor) over
;; the first 's' in setq, and press K on the keyboard. Boom!


;; SECOND BEST WAY? I think the above is for elisp, so I can use M-x sly-describe-symbol which seems to do the same thing but for common lisp!


;; THIRD BEST WAY TO LOOK UP DOCS
(documentation 'cons 'function) ; where cons can be any function

;;; DEFINING VARIBLES

;;; sc note this:

;;; (defvar aaa 5)
;;; (defvar aaa 7)
;;; (print aaa)
;;; 5
;;;
;;; (setf aaa 9)
;;; (print aaa)
;;; 9

;;; in other words, defvar is like orequals, except ||= will define if the object is
;;; nil, whereas I don't think defvar does that. Basically defvar will set the
;;; variable only if it isn't already defined e.g. useful for global variables
;;; so tl;dr someone like me who rarely uses globals probably should just stick
;;; to using defparameter rather than defvar


(defparameter aaa 5)
(print aaa)
;;; 5

(defparameter aaa 7)
(print aaa)
;;; 7
;;; sc: yup, for behaviour more like what I'm used to, use defparamater
;;; rather than defvar





(defvar x 6)

(print 5)

;;; quick summary of 5 ways to define variables in common lisp


;;; Defines a global variable and initializes it with a value. The variable can be changed later.
(defparameter *var* 10)

(documentation 'defparameter 'function)

;;; "Define a parameter that is not normally changed by the program,
;;; but that may be changed without causing an error. Declare the
;;; variable special and sets its value to VAL, overwriting any
;;; previous...[sly-elided string of length 283]"

;;; Similar to defparameter, but if the variable already exists, it does not reinitialize it.
(defvar *var* 10)


;;;setq sets the value of a variable. Can be used for both local and global variables.
(setq var 20)

;;; let defines local variables scoped within a block.

(let ((x 10)
      (y 20))
  (+ x y))


;;; let* similar to let, but allows for variables defined in the form to
;;; depend on those defined earlier
(let* ((x 10)
       (y (+ x 10)))
  (+ x y))




;;; some great examples from a stack overflow answer:
;;; https://stackoverflow.com/a/1475814/5783745
;;;
(set ls '(1 2 3 4)) => Error - ls has no value

(set 'ls '(1 2 3 4)) => OK

(setq ls '(1 2 3 4)) => OK - make ls to (quote ls) and then have the usual set

(setf ls '(1 2 3 4)) => OK - same as setq so far BUT

(setf (car ls) 10) => Makes ls '(10 2 3 4) - not duplicated by setq/set

(reduce #'-

;;; these could be rewritten as

;;; tl;dr there's actually three ways to do the same thing
;;; #' and (function) are the same, but ' does something slightly
;;; different which might result in the same outcome most the time

;; â‡’ 0
;; sc: explanation of the reduce/reverse example above:
;; first the list is reversed (so it's 3 2 1), then reduce applies the - (subtraction)
;; operator to each of the successive elements e.g. 3-2, then the result - 1, =0
;; in other words 'reduce' successively applies the function to the first and second elemnts and moves along
;; to go through all elements
;; + might have been a simpler (if less elegant) example:

(reduce #'+
        (list 1 2 3 4))
;; 10


;; a bit more on using #' (alisas for (function)) vs just '
;; from common lisp discord
(defun foo () (write-line "Global foo"))

(foo)

(funcall #'foo) ; => Global foo
(funcall 'foo) ; => Global foo

(flet ((foo () (write-line "Local foo")))
  (funcall #'foo) ; => Local foo
  (funcall 'foo)) ; => Global foo


;; Use #' to get the function object from the relevant lexical scope.
;; This means that if there's a local binding (e.g., within a `flet`
;; or `labels` block), it will take precedence over a global definition.

;; sc: (my 2c) interesting meta-learning googling (static|dynamic|lexical) scoping
;; is to research categories (labels), but understanding the underlying concept
;; of 'scope resolution order' (a term not found so commonly on literature)
;; seems a much more fruitful to me, since you stop trying to understand each label
;; and realise each language can do whatever the hell it wants (it just happens)
;; that most languages fit into one of a few different categories above


;; From: https://lisp-lang.org/
(mapcar #'string-downcase
        (list "Hello" "World!"))
;; => ("hello" "world!")

;; what's it doing?

(string-downcase "Boom!")

;;; how to look up documentation for a lisp function
;;; my tldr:
;;; use (describe) since it has one less argument than (documentation)
;;; e.g.
(describe 'defun)
(describe '*print-base*)
(describe '*print-case*)
(setq *print-case* :capitalize)
(print *print-case*) ; this prints the new value (:Capitalize)
(describe '*print-case*) ; but this says no value. Maybe a lisp quirk. Investigate later.

(describe 'format)
;;; Note that this ^^^ doesn't seem to work
;; apparently this site is really good: https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw50/CLHS/Front/Contents.htm

;;; So you probably have to tell the (documentation) function the kind
;;; thing that it is. E.g.

;;; Anatomy of a macro:
;;;
;;; Backquote: This is a special quoting mechanism used in Lisp macros.
;;; It allows parts of the quoted list to be evaluated and interpolated into the list,
;;; which is crucial for constructing new code dynamically.
;;;
;;; Comma: The comma is used within a backquoted expression to indicate that
;;; what follows is an expression that should be evaluated and the result spliced
;;; into the code during macro expansion.
;;;
;;; Splice (,@): The ,@ operator is used before an expression that results in a list,
;;; and it means that the list should be "spliced" into the surrounding code.
;;; That is, instead of inserting the list itself,
;;; the elements of the list are inserted.


;;; Note the difference between '(a b) and (list a b) is the former uses a quote before
;;; the parentheses, which inhibis the evaluation of the contents inside the parantheses
;;; e.g. it directly returns (a b) as a literal list, with symbols a and b unchanged.
;;; Whereas (list a b) is a function with a and b as arguments, so it will be evaluated
;;; but only after a and b are evaluated as variables adn their values used in the (list)
;;; function call to create a new list.
