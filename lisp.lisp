;; From: https://lisp-lang.org/
(reduce #'-
        (reverse (list 1 2 3)))
;; â‡’ 0
;; sc: explanation: first the list is reversed (so it's 3 2 1), then reduce applies the - (subtraction)
;; operator to each of the successive elements e.g. 3-2, then the result - 1, =0
;; in other words 'reduce' successively applies the function to the first and second elemnts and moves along
;; to go through all elements
;; + might have been a simpler (if less elegant) example:

(reduce #'+
        (list 1 2 3 4))
;; 10
